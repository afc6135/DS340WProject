# DS340WProject
The code for the DS340W GraphCast Code. ALL CHANGES ARE DETAILED BELOW WITH DATES

INSTRUCTIONS!!:
1. Download the notebook: Group48graphcastFinal.ipynb.
2. Download the dataset: WeatherDataP.
3. Upload both(Python notebook and the csv file) to Google Colab(see step 5 for specific upload instructions for the CSV File)
4. Make sure Colab is set to Python 3 with the base CPU runtime.
5. Upload the weather dataset into the Colab file system: (Go into the file tab on the left hand side, click file upload and upload the WeatherDataP.csv file)
7. Connect and run all cells without interacting with any of the dropdowns or widgets (since they’re preconfigured). Do this by going to runtime on the top and clicking run all.
8. Ignore high RAM usage alerts — the code has been optimized to safely run within Colab’s free tier limits.
9. Look for the RMSE and Loss metrics at the bottom of the notebook in the training section — the expected values will be written in the comments or markdown.
10. If modifying code(Preferably not), you must restart the Colab runtime and run all cells from the top again to ensure consistent results.

April 19th:
Added comments to the code and fixed the ReadMe for the instructors and TA

2 Months Ago: 
The first implimentation was just the code we submitted from the paper paper, something we wanted to work with.
This was implimented a few months and had slight changes to support the memory limitations of google colab

February 24th:
The second implimentation was access to our data in csv format, we only used it to get the csv data and did not need any more code past it to run since we just needed the data
This was completed February 24th. We now have access to the first of many datasets in csv format(however large at over 90 mb) 

March 23rd: 
The third implimentation was the readdition of the model items and the loss calcuation specifically. We also looked at adding RMSE calculations to the code to see how it compared and fared to Gencast and Pangu Weather(other ML models).
These changes were made between March 16th to March 23rd. 
These changes also came with minor changes to the data and testing with different lead times to see what we can do to improve our lead times 
RMSE, Loss, and some loss changes were made to improve the loss.
